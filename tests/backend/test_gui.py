"""
Real-environment tests for the gui.py entry.

Starting `python gui.py` must bring up the whole process chain
(supervisor -> backend via multiprocessing spawn) and shut down cleanly
afterwards. The detailed behaviors of the supervisor / backend / worker
are covered by unit tests; this file only verifies the real startup and
shutdown path, talking to the process through the stdin command channel
exactly like the Electron webapp does.
