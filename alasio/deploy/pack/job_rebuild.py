class RebuildJob(ResetJob):
    """
    A rebuild task from the server: download the latest index pack,
    remove the leftover files of the old version and rebuild the
    working tree to the latest version, interruptible and resumable.

    Unlike ResetJob, the local index pack is never trusted: the latest
    index pack is downloaded unconditionally (download_index()), then
    the working tree is verified against it. The leftover files are the
    difference between the old local index and the new one, so only
    managed files are removed, files the user placed by hand are
    untouched. The old fileinfo is read before the new index is
    downloaded, and the new index pack is replaced last in replace():
    an interruption during replace() leaves the old index pack in
    place, so a resumed run still computes the leftover deletion list
    from it.

    write() stores the RBIL marker to the job file, the marker is
    dispatched to a resumed RebuildJob by
    DeployJob.get_unfinished_job().

    Note: the exclusive lock on .pack/index.pack in the draft is shared
    by the whole update flow (full pack, update pack and file check),
    the caller is responsible for it.

        first. Every file is verified against the new index, the

        files. The new index pack is replaced last, see the class
