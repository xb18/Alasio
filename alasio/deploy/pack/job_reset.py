class ResetJob(JobBase):
    """
    A local file validation and repair task, interruptible and
    resumable.

    The job writes the marker to the job file .pack/workspace/job.pack
    with write() before validating, so an interrupted run can be
    resumed by the next run:

        job = DeployJob.get_unfinished_job(server)
        if job is None:
            job = ResetJob(server)
            job.write()
        job.run()

    The local index pack .pack/index.pack is read once and cached.
    validate_index() checks the index pack itself, a failed index pack
    is prepared again from the server (download_index()). Then
    validate_latest() compares the local index pack checksum with the
    latest index pack checksum of the server, an outdated (self-
    consistent but not the latest) index pack is prepared again too.
    The new index pack is downloaded to the workspace new_index.tmp
    instead of replacing the local index directly, replace() applies
    it together with the repaired files, so the real files are
    touched only once. Then validate_files() checks every file
    recorded in the index, failed files are downloaded to tmp files
    by download() and replaced to the real files by replace(). Files
    that cannot be downloaded or fail the size + sha1 check stay in
    self.error with an empty tmp, this is an unsolvable problem per
    the draft of PackEncodeBase.

    Note: the exclusive lock on .pack/index.pack in the draft is shared
    by the whole update flow (full pack, update pack and file check),
    the caller is responsible for it.
