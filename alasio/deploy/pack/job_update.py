class SourceError(Exception):
    """
    Raised when the source file of a record fails the size + sha1 check.

    The record is kept in self.error, download() fetches its content
    from the new full pack instead.
    """


class UpdateJob(JobBase):
    """
    An update pack unpack task, interruptible and resumable.

    The pack data is passed in __init__, the caller stores it to the
    job file .pack/workspace/job.pack with write() before unpacking,
    so an interrupted run can be resumed by the next run:

        job = DeployJob.get_unfinished_job(server)
        if job is not None:
            job.run()
        job = UpdateJob(data, server=server)
        job.write()
        job.run()

    The update pack upgrades the local working tree from the old
    version to the new version, every file follows the same flow:
    read - verify - decompress to a tmp file, file content never
    stays in memory. The index pack .pack/index.pack is a normal
    record of the update:

    1. unpack() decompresses every file to .pack/workspace/
       {size}_{sha1}_{index}.tmp, real files are untouched. Records
       are computed from the update pack data and the old files
       recorded in refinfo: A records are decompressed directly, C
       (copied) records copy the source blob (read from the tmp file
       of the earlier new file, or from the verified working tree
       file), M / RM records decompress a zstd patch from the old
       file, R (renamed) records move the old file. The record of
       the index pack is an M record from the old index to the new
       index: the local .pack/index.pack is verified against the
       refinfo like any other old file, a self-consistent but wrong
       local index fails the check. A source that fails the size +
       sha1 check (missing, wrong content or unfixable EOL) is kept
       in self.error.
    2. download() fetches the content of the failed records from the
       full pack of the new version (the new index pack records
       carry the offsets), like ResetJob, and writes their tmp
       files. The index pack record is downloaded as a whole index
       pack, it is not a file of the new full pack. The local source
       files are not repaired: the update brings the records of the
       update pack to the new version, the other files are checked
       by ResetJob. Records that cannot be downloaded or fail the
       size + sha1 check stay in self.error, this is an unsolvable
       problem per the draft of PackEncodeBase.
    3. replace() moves every tmp file to the target path atomically,
       removes the deleted markers and the renamed sources, and
       writes the new index pack like any other file.

    On failure the workspace is kept, the next run resumes from it.

    Note: the exclusive lock on .pack/index.pack in the draft is shared
    by the whole update flow (full pack, update pack and file check),
    the caller is responsible for it.
