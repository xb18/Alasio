class UnpackJob(JobBase):
    """
    A full pack unpack task, interruptible and resumable.

    Unpacking is a local rebuild: the working tree is rebuilt from the
    full pack data passed in __init__, the leftover files of the old
    version (recorded in the old local index pack, not in this pack)
    are removed, the new index pack replaces .pack/index.pack last.
    No server is involved. The pack data is passed in __init__, the
    caller stores it to the job file .pack/workspace/job.pack with
    write() before unpacking, so an interrupted run can be resumed by
    the next run:

        job = DeployJob.get_unfinished_job()
        if job is not None:
            job.unpack()
            job.replace()
        job = UnpackJob(data)
        job.write()
        job.unpack()
        job.replace()

    All files unpack into env.PROJECT_ROOT, the pack structure (.pack/)
    lives inside it. The unpack flow follows the draft in PackEncodeBase:

    1. unpack() reads the old local index pack, writes the index
       section to .pack/workspace/new_index.tmp and decompresses all
       files to .pack/workspace/{size}_{sha1}_{index}.tmp, real files
       are untouched. The leftover files of the old version, recorded
       in the old index but not in this pack, are appended as deleted
       markers, and the new index pack is the last record: an
       interruption during replace() leaves the old index pack in
       place, so a resumed run still computes the leftover deletion
       list from it. Files that exist and pass the size + sha1 check
       are skipped, leftover tmp files that pass the check are reused.
    2. replace() moves every tmp file to the target path atomically and
       removes the deleted markers. Real file operations only start
       after every tmp file is ready, so an interruption never leaves a
       half-mixed set of old and new files.
    3. cleanup() cleans .pack/workspace atomically: the folder is
       renamed first, then removed slowly, so an interrupted cleanup
       never leaves a workspace that looks unfinished.

    On failure the workspace is kept, the next run resumes from it.

    Note: the exclusive lock on .pack/index.pack in the draft is shared
    by the whole update flow (full pack, update pack and file check),
    the caller is responsible for it.
