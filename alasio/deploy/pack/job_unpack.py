class UnpackJob(JobBase):
    """
    A full pack unpack task, interruptible and resumable.

    The pack data is passed in __init__, the caller stores it to the job
    file .pack/workspace/job.pack with write() before unpacking, so an
    interrupted run can be resumed by the next run:

        job = DeployJob.get_unfinished_job()
        if job is not None:
            job.unpack()
            job.replace()
        job = UnpackJob(data)
        job.write()
        job.unpack()
        job.replace()

    All files unpack into env.PROJECT_ROOT, the pack structure (.pack/)
    lives inside it. The unpack flow follows the draft in PackEncodeBase:

    1. unpack() writes the index section to .pack/index.pack and
       decompresses all files to .pack/workspace/{size}_{sha1}_{index}.tmp,
       real files are untouched. Files that exist and pass the size +
       sha1 check are skipped, leftover tmp files that pass the check
       are reused.
    2. replace() moves every tmp file to the target path atomically and
       removes the deleted markers. Real file operations only start
       after every tmp file is ready, so an interruption never leaves a
       half-mixed set of old and new files.
    3. cleanup() cleans .pack/workspace atomically: the folder is
       renamed first, then removed slowly, so an interrupted cleanup
       never leaves a workspace that looks unfinished.

    On failure the workspace is kept, the next run resumes from it.

    Note: the exclusive lock on .pack/index.pack in the draft is shared
    by the whole update flow (full pack, update pack and file check),
    the caller is responsible for it.
