        The unified entry of the file check flow in the draft of
        PackEncodeBase:

        1. the latest version and its index pack checksum are read
           from latest.pack, the local version comes from the local
           index pack .pack/index.pack
        2. a version mismatch downloads the update pack
           /{new_version}/from_{old_version}.pack and applies it with
           UpdateJob, a missing update pack (out of the update window
           or removed) falls back to RebuildJob, a failed update also
           falls back to RebuildJob
        3. the same version continues with ResetJob: the local index
           pack is checked against the latest checksum (an outdated
           self-consistent index is downloaded again), then every
           recorded file is verified and repaired

        A missing or malformed local index pack has an unknown
        version, the update cannot be incremental: RebuildJob
        downloads the latest index unconditionally and rebuilds the
        working tree from it. The unfinished job is finished inside,
        the caller does not need to care about it.
