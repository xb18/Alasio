        The thread never blocks on a read: it only reads bytes that are
        already available in the pipe, so it always notices the stop event
        within one poll cycle and can be joined by stop_stdin_listener. The
        idle wait lives inside the platform read_available(): Windows sleeps
        one poll cycle after an empty peek, POSIX lets select wait instead
        of sleeping. The listener must be stopped (see stop_stdin_listener)
        while a backend process is spawning, otherwise multiprocessing spawn
        hangs on Windows.

        EOF semantics: when stdin is a pipe, EOF means the parent process
        (Electron) closed its write end, i.e. the parent is gone. The
        listener sets _stdin_eof; recv_loop turns that into a
        ParentProcessExited so run() performs the graceful shutdown, which
        sends command:stop to the backend (with a force-kill fallback).
        The listener itself does not send anything: the shutdown path owns
        the stop command, so sending it here would be redundant.
        EOF on non-pipe stdin (console or redirected file) only stops the
        listener, matching the original behavior: parent-death detection
        only applies to the pipe stdin that Electron provides.
