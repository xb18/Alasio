# =============================================================================
# PROCESS BOUNDARY
#
# This module is imported by the SUPERVISOR process only (gui.py __main__
# block). The backend child reaches the web stack through
# entry.backend_entry (alasio.backend.entry), never through this file.
# Keep heavy backend imports (app.py / starlette / trio / hypercorn) OUT of
# this module: a module-level import here would pull the whole web stack
# into the supervisor process.
# =============================================================================

# Backend entry file should not have any heavy global import
# otherwise every child process will import them in spawn mode.
# The two module-level imports below are light: entry.py is stdlib-only,
# supervisor.py is stdlib-only. The actual backend entry (app.py, starlette,
# trio, hypercorn) is imported lazily in alasio.backend.entry.backend_entry.

    # attribute becomes a bound method on instance access, and pickling the

    # pickled into the backend child as spawn args, and the function lives
    # in alasio.backend.entry (stdlib-only), so the child process never
    # imports this file nor supervisor.py.
