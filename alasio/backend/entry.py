# =============================================================================
# PROCESS BOUNDARY -- ALL alasio imports in this file must stay LOCAL
# (inside functions).
#
# This module is the backend child entry: the spawn target
# (backend_process_entry) and the entry callable (backend_entry) are
# pickled into the backend child by module path, and the supervisor process
# imports this module too (start_backend). The child therefore only imports
# THIS file plus stdlib. Module-level imports must stay stdlib-only;
# every alasio import here must be a local import, or it leaks the web
# stack / backend business modules across the supervisor / backend process
# boundary.
# =============================================================================

# Backend process entry point.
#
# The spawn target and the backend entry callable live in their own module
# (stdlib imports only) so the backend child process only ever imports this
# file when multiprocessing deserializes the spawn arguments. supervisor.py
# and backend.py are supervisor-process modules: keeping them out of the
# backend process keeps the process boundary clean.

    Entry point for the backend process.

    Runs in the child process. Sets up the pipe connection as a global
    variable that the backend code can access, then starts the actual backend
    application.

    A module-level function instead of a bound method: the process object is
    pickled into the child, and pickling the Supervisor instance (with its
    cyclic process/pipe references) makes spawn hang on Windows when stdin is
    a pipe.

        args (list[str] | None): Command line args for the backend
