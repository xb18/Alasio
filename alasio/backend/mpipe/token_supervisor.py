    APIs locked).

    The supervisor is the single source of truth for tokens: it
    generates, holds, rotates, sends down the pipe and announces them;
    Electron only listens to the announcements and never inputs a token.

    exception: it is announced before the backend is born).

    send_bytes_to_backend() (which holds the supervisor-side send lock):
    this manager never touches parent_conn directly.
